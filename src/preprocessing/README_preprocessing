The perl script preprocessing.pl takes a list of links to osm files downloadable from geofabrik.org and processes their input such that
- street names are extracted
- information is stored in a table including street names, coordinates, country, street IDs and corresponding nodes on the map and further information
- for each entry in the input file, there will be several output files in the given output folder containing information needed to further analyse the street names

Requirements:
- osmium-tool (possibly inside a conda environment)
- perl5
- python3

This folder contains an example input file which contains links to maps in France.
Please create an output folder, e.g. outfolder_france
The script will write a log file as specified by the program call, here log_countries_france.txt

The script can be called by:

perl preprocessing.pl example_input_countries_france.txt outfolder_france log_countries_france.txt
