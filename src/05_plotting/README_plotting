The folder contains scripts to plot street densities based on the results of the previous steps.

There are two different kinds of plots:

- completeStreetDensity: here, the script will plot the street densities for a complete country based on the osm data that is available.
The resulting plots show nicely how streets are distributed inside a country. If there is a lot of data available within OSM, the street densities
also relfect population densities.

- originbasedStreetDensity: this script will plot street densities for streets with a given origin, i.e. only streets in North America with a french origin.


Requirements:
- python3
- python basemap (can be installed using conda)


Input:
- a list of all files starting with 05andhalf that should be included in the analysis, for e.g. france, the files can be summarize by:
ls france/05andhalf* > 05andhalf_france.txt (-i)
- the current folder/working directory (-t)
- the -a parameter is set to 1 for completeStreetDensity and set to 0 for originbasedStreetDensity
- for originbasedStreetDensity, a file containing the streets to plot the density for has to be given as an input (-f)

Output:
- the plot as a pdf file will be given as an output (-o)
- for originbasedStreetDensity, the coordinates of the mapped streets will be listed in another output file (-c)


The script can be called by:

completeStreetDensity:
python ownDensityEurope.py -i 05andhalf_europe.txt -t ./ -a 1 -o densityplotEurope.pdf

originbasedStreetDensity:
python scripts/ownDensityNorthAmericaWithFile.py -i 05andhalf_NorthAmerica.txt -t ./ -a 0 -f 13_classifiedStreetsNorthAmerica_byAustria.tsv -c coordinates_byAustria.tsv -o densityPlotNorthAmerica_byAustria.pdf
