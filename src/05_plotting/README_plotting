The folder contains scripts to plot street densities based on the results of the previous steps.

There are two different kinds of plots:

- completeStreetDensity: here, the script will plot the street densities for a complete country based on the osm data that is available.
The resulting plots show nicely how streets are distributed inside a country. If there is a lot of data available within OSM, the street densities
also relfect population densities.

- originbasedStreetDensity: this script will plot street densities for streets with a given origin, i.e. only streets in North America with a french origin.
