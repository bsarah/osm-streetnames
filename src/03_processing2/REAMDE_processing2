The second processing step will summarize files from the previous step and starts with the cluster detection.

Requirements:
- perl5


Input:
- a file that lists 111a files. The file has to include the path to the files, too. Thus, a line in the file might be: france/111a_alsace.tsv
- the second input is the current folder, from which one can find the files and pathes specified in the input file.

Output:
- no output files have to be specified, the produced output will be stored in the same folder as the input files,
thus in the case above, the ouput will be stored in the folder france.


The script can be called by:
perl processing112.pl list_111afiles_france.txt ./
