This script will collect the street mappings and classifications for a whole country based on the
output of the previous processing steps.

As an example, consider the folder france, thus osm files for France have been downloaded and preprocessed (step01),
specifics have been mapped, and verified or classified by fasttext (step02) and files have been summarized and
cluster detection has been done (step03).
Now, the folder france contains a large number of files, whereas the file names start with numbers, here 03xx up to 12xx.
Every filename additionally contains the country/state/region such that the order of the numbers shows the order of how the files have been produced.


Of course, France is only an example. We can also have complete Europe, North America or Africa where we collect the 12xx files for and proceed.


Requirements:
- perl5
- For this step, the 12xx files are needed. Here, we now list all the 12xx files for the complete folder france by:
ls france/12_* > 12_classifiedStreetsFrance.txt
This file will be the input file for the current step.


Further input:
- the current working directory
- the country we want to get the streets from


Output:
- the call below will output a list of street names in France that have been mapped or classified to be of Austrian origin.

The script can be called by:
perl getStreetsByCountry.pl 12_classifiedStreetsFrance.txt ./ austria 13_classifiedStreetsFrance_byAustria_alleuro_mino000001.tsv
