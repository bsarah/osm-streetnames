This script will use the extracted street specifics data in order to find European origins of street names.
These results will be verified by the fasttext language identifier or, in case no European origin could be found,
fasttext language identifier will try to identify the language.


Requirements:
- fasttext has to be installed, this can be done using conda (https://fasttext.cc/)
- download and save the fasttext model (https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/language-identification.html) called lid.176.bin
- perl5
- python3


Input:
1) a list of all 09a-files, the list has to be located in the same folder as the listed files
(the 09a files are contained in the output of the previous step, preprocessing)
2) the fasttext model

Output:
The output is a list for all countries/states in the input and corresponding numbers about how many street specifics
were matched to European specifics, how many have been verified correctly and how many have been classified by the
fasttext language classifier. See also publication for more details on the workflow.

The script can be called by:
