Analysis of street names based on OSM data

This repository includes a pipeline of perl and python scripts that allow to
download and analyse street name data based on OpenStreetMap.

The src folder contains subfolders with further instructions for the
pipeline steps 01-05.

The workflow is depicted in the corresponding publication.
